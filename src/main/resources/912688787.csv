If you print a lot each month, be prepared to purchase new ink on a monthly basis. It did come with 3 months free of instaink, which was a plus for me as I printed quite a bit each month of the trial. If I was going to continue printing numerous pages each month, the instaink subscription was fine and worth paying for, but once I started paying for the subscription and going over the subscription amount, it was costly and I ended the subscription. It was better for me to purchase the ink on Amazon. Again, the drawback to this printer is the limited printing capabilities of the cartridge.

"5","Highly recommend for college students. Awesome printer. My wife is in nursing school and has to print stuff off a lot. Last printer we had we kept having ink issues. I seen this at the store and couldn’t believe how good the price was for a laser printer. Set up was a breeze. Love that me and my wife and anyone hooked to the wifi at home can use this printer. I bought this with my own money and did not receive anything. I highly recommend for college students. Or anyone needing to print alot. The toner cartridges are way cheaper thank ink also.","Backwoodsbagger","4/3/2022","Unverified"
"5","HP LaserJet MFP M139we Wireless Black HP Laserjet M139we is an amazing product and I would highly recommend to all the ones who uses printer, scanner and copier. HP has taken an intelligent step to club all of these 3 capabilities in one which has provided a customer an efficient way to use it effectively. Salient features: 1. Laser printer - I have used it extensively as i just recently got it. Laser printer is great and really helps you to complete your job in a timely manner. The tray has been placed at a right place and takes a bunch of paper at one time and the wireless functionality makes it really easier to send the command from anywhere without having a hassle of wires n all. 2. Copier: This is the best thing in which HP has embedded the copier with the printer which re...See more","Umer","6/30/2022","Unverified"
"5","Great We have needed a new printer for a while for my work and my boys school and all I can say is I love this little printer! First it takes up little room which I love! It's fast when coping or send it through the Wi-Fi unable drive way which I love being able to send from my phone or tablet without having to open my computer! My 9 year old son loves to print coloring pictures and he dan operate this one by himself without having me stop what I'm doing and printing for him! This is just an overal great printer and perfect for my family! received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.","Jennifer","4/6/2022","Unverified"
"5","Great Little Printer! Amazing little work horse!! This printer was very easy to set up, just took a few minutes! If all you need is to print in black and white this is the machine for you. It is fast, quiet, and takes up very little space! Have been using for a week now and love the quality of the prints. The wireless printing is very convenient as everyone is able to print from their own device with out having to use any wires! The toner replacement cost is possible the only concern, but it seems that it will last a long time! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","Jackeline","5/11/2022","Unverified"
"1","Negative This printer sucks. It only prints black, no color and doesn’t print 2 sided. Way to expensive for the loss of features. These positive opinions are from people who got a discount buying it in exchange for a positive opinion on here and they probably brought it back afterwards. HP printers suck, they have broken up all the features so you have to pay way more for a printer now with less features and HP printers break and you never get them to work again. They don’t care, they just take your money.","HP Team Hi there.I’m sorry that you’re so thoroughly dissatisfied with your printer.

"5","Love it! This is a great printer. Setting it up was super easy with the HP Smart app on my computer and I was up and running in less than 10 minutes. The prints are great on plain paper, and look even better on a nice laser paper. My customers have never been happier with the quality of their prints. It prints really quickly, I had 100 pages printed in a few minutes. I love the small footprint of this printer. It takes up a small amount of space in my small office which is a huge plus for me. It came with a toner already installed which is great but I really like that it came with 6 months of HP Instant Ink and I've already received my first shipment of toner for free. The wireless feature is pretty standard, however I had no issue connecting it to ...See more","pixxiestix","7/6/2022","Unverified"
"5","GREAT! This is a great and affordable printer. It's not too heavy so it is easy to setup and move around. It is super quick and not too noisy. The app is great! You can make copies, scan, and even send a fax through the app. I love it so far, and it has made my work way more efficient.

"5","Gets the job done This HP Laserjet printer is small but works just as well as any other. Extremely easy to set up. pretty much just plug it in and connect to wifi. The wifi connection is simple and every time i turn it on it is automatically connected. So far after a month of use, the paper feed has never jammed. It is speedy and precise. The ink is dark and had never smeared or had any patches. scanning is fast and efficient. This printer will get your job done. The only downside is that there is no color. I would recommend this to anyone with large printing jobs that do not require color. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.","Stephen","5/3/2022","Unverified"
"4","Great printer This is a really great little printer for the money. It has a relatively small footprint that doesn’t take up a ton of space on the desk. Print speed is adequate. No major issues on waiting for a print job to complete and every page looks amazing. Sharp, crisp prints that are easy to read and don’t fade. The one issue I had was that the printer only has 2.4 ghz wireless and I mainly run on 5ghz from my laptop so getting it set up was interesting till o realized what the issue was. After that everything worked as expected. This printer comes with the usual site of HP apps and software. Easy to use and set up. My brand new Computer worked flawlessly. Highly recommended. I received this printer at a discount for my honest opinion.","Barry","4/20/2022","Unverified"
"5","Small printer that acts big received this printer at a discount for my honest review. This printer is an easy one to recommend. It came out of the box and I set it up and had it working in less than 10 minutes. It doesn't require a lot of space which is great as I didn't have a lot of room on my desk. It works seamlessly with my laptop and my Android phone. There are features I have yet to tap into because my printing needs are simple. I want it to print fast (which it does) and I don't want to see messy printing. This printer produces great output. I printed out one picture to see what it would look like, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality it produced. If there was one area for improvement it would be the paper tray, although with its diminutive size I'm n...See more","NiteOwl","7/2/2022","Unverified"
