2,"Doesn’t stay connected to WiFi I’ve used many Laserjet printers over the years, mostly networked by Ethernet, and this printer just doesn’t live up to the standards. Nice looking, nice print quality, when it prints. It seems to not wake to print most of the time, falls offline from the network, states there’s an invisible paper jam, has trouble printing of it has only a few sheets of paper left, but also doesn’t like too much paper. It completely forgot its WiFi connection at least once where I had to reprogram it. So much hassle for a AirPrint printer. I have another HP inkjet that cost us $20 on an Amazon Prime deal that prints through WiFi every time without issue. This just doesn’t want to work like it should.

1,"Not worth the price, scanner is too glitchy Scan image quality is poor, not easy to set up AT ALL. Kept getting driver error messages; had to attempt drivers reloading many, many times, over several hours and days. I was not able to set up where all functions work. Strictly as a printer, it might work fine, but for the scanner function ?? A big NOPE.",Absinthia2night,5/18/2023,Unverified,-1.0,-1.0,0.0
