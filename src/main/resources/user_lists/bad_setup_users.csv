2,"Poor setup, poor service from HP Get ready to be mad, while it might be an OK printer, setup is beyond frustrating. I'm an IT guy and i've never fought a printer so much on setup. On initial installation everything worked, the printet was recognized by the PC, scanning was an easy setup. But, after 10 pages it locks up and says that the printer setup is not comete and must be completed. Many hours later its still not working, HP support SUCKS. They may end up getting it working, but their insistence on registration is what caused the problem in the first place. Big brother watching...",Shaun,11/25/2023,Unverified,-0.5,0.0,0.0
1,"Absolute piece of junk! Can't even try out the printer as it won't install on the computer or through the app on the phone. The computer finds it, but when you select it and click continue, nothing happens. Cell phone app can't even find the printer. Absolutely ridiculous that it is this difficult to set up a printer in 2023. How was it so easy to install a printer in 1998 and impossible 25 years later??","Absolute piece of junk!

1,"Not worth the price, scanner is too glitchy Scan image quality is poor, not easy to set up AT ALL. Kept getting driver error messages; had to attempt drivers reloading many, many times, over several hours and days. I was not able to set up where all functions work. Strictly as a printer, it might work fine, but for the scanner function ?? A big NOPE.",Absinthia2night,5/18/2023,Unverified,-1.0,-1.0,0.0
